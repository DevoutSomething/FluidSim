Fluid Simulation Project:


A simple interactive browser based 2D fluid simulation based on the math shown in the video But How DO Fluid Simulations Work?
by the youtube channel Gonkee (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsYE1wMEMPA&t). This project models diffusion and velocity based
particle motion using a grid representation allowing the user to "paint" particles on the screen and watch the fluid move dynamically.

Preview:

Features:
- Fluid-like motion using velocity and density
- Mouse based drawing
- Sliders to adjust the parameters of the simulation

Built With:
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla Javascript
- Styled with CSS

  How to Use
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/devoutsomething/fluid-simulation.git
cd fluid-simulation
Open the simulation:
Simply double-click index.html or open it in your browser.

Start interacting:
Click and drag on the canvas to add fluid.
Use the sliders above the canvas to tweak the simulation behavior.


Concepts used: 
- Basic multivariable calculus conceps such as vector fields
- Diffusion algorithms
- Grid based simulation on canvas
- Interactive input handeling
